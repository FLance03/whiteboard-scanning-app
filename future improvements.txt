- not lessening the quality (currently all images must be the same height and that transformed image is used as the output image)
- if there is no redundant between pictures it still chooses because median
- if few redundant median forces it to choose also
- when things are in the box (ex: 2021-08-23 10-39-30 (1) -> 0.jpg and 1.jpg)
- lose definition on resize
- gets worse the farther the picture
- maybe ML instead the group of CCs not per cell?
- give preference to nearer photos timewise
- it reports as redundant with a box so even if something inside (like a table or number) is not redundant it becomes included
